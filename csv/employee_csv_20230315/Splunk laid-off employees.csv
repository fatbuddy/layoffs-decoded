2/1/2023 11:28:48,April,Wright,Sr Security Architect,SGS Security Architecture,Boston area,Remote Only,https://architectsecurity.org,"I have: - Media training- Soft Skills- Experience in various formats of writing (blog, formal, news articles) and copy editing- Experience giving in-person and online training- Strong background in:--- GRC--- Privacy--- SDLC processes- No issue with working long-term, odd hours that accommodate global organizational timezones- Management experience (though I prefer IC)I'd love to move into a full time ""security awareness"" program role. Even if it were only one part of a broader role. Going back into GRC is also a very reasonable next step for meI've had at least some past experience doing almost everything in infosec (NOT pen testing, malware analysis, and threat hunting). I started as a UNIX admin and app dev (perl, php, shell, C, pascal, basic, hypercard...)I'm comfortable in *NIX command line, and reviewing settings in enterprise apps, but I'm not a ""hands-on"" engineer or a dev anymoreMy focus is on people and process. Proactive risk mitigation, shifting security left, overarching processes, providing guidance and consultation on a myriad of topics, writing policies, etc. I'm great at explaining very complex security topics in simple ways that non-infosec people can understand.anyway, it's been a pleasure, friends! <3"
